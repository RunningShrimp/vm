# Lint configuration
# These lints are enabled by default:
# - clippy::all: All lints that are on by default
# - clippy::pedantic: Pedantic lints that are stricter

# Disallowed methods (e.g., unwrap, expect)
# These should be handled via Result/Option properly
# Configure in workflow with: -W clippy::unwrap_used -W clippy::expect_used
